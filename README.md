# Omnisana

Sync your Todos between Asana and OmniFocus.

## Installation

Clone the directory. Intent is to gemify this soon enough.

## Usage

    ./omnisana -a 'apikey123' -i -v


## Caveats

Quite a few. This is basically at prototype status at this point. It works for me (tm), but you probably have very specific things that you'd hate about it.

**However**, if you just need a dump of all your Asana Todos to dump into your OmniFocus, and then you want to sync the completed status of those items back to Asana, then we can do that for you right now.
